-ln file1.txt file2.txt
    after this command the two files have the same inode value and contents.
-edit file 2;
    file 1 is also changed to the same content.
-rm file 1
    file 2 still exists.
-strace rm file2.txt
    system call = execve("/usr/bin/rm", ["rm", "file2.txt"], 0x7ffe75dbefb8 /* 55 vars */) = 0
    (execve is the sys call)
-ln -s file3.txt file4.txt
    file3 inode=457442
    file4 inode=457443
    inode is different but the content is the same in the files.
    Also after changing file 4, file 3 is changed to the same content.
    After deleting file3 file 4 is also deleted because the link is broken.
